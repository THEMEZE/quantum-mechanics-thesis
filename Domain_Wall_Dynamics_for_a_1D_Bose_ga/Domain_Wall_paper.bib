	abstract = {We consider the nonequilibrium time evolution of piecewise homogeneous states in the XXZ spin-1/2 chain, a paradigmatic example of an interacting integrable model. The initial state can be thought of as the result of joining chains with different global properties. Through dephasing, at late times, the state becomes locally equivalent to a stationary state which explicitly depends on position and time. We propose a kinetic theory of elementary excitations and derive a continuity equation which fully characterizes the thermodynamics of the model. We restrict ourselves to the gapless phase and consider cases where the chains are prepared: (1) at different temperatures, (2) in the ground state of two different models, and (3) in the “domain wall” state. We find excellent agreement (any discrepancy is within the numerical error) between theoretical predictions and numerical simulations of time evolution based on time-evolving block decimation algorithms. As a corollary, we unveil an exact expression for the expectation values of the charge currents in a generic stationary state.},

	abstract = {Understanding the general principles underlying strongly interacting quantum states out of equilibrium is one of the most important tasks of current theoretical physics. With experiments accessing the intricate dynamics of many-body quantum systems, it is paramount to develop powerful methods that encode the emergent physics. Up to now, the strong dichotomy observed between integrable and nonintegrable evolutions made an overarching theory difficult to build, especially for transport phenomena where space-time profiles are drastically different. We present a novel framework for studying transport in integrable systems: hydrodynamics with infinitely many conservation laws. This bridges the conceptual gap between integrable and nonintegrable quantum dynamics, and gives powerful tools for accurate studies of space-time profiles. We apply it to the description of energy transport between heat baths, and provide a full description of the current-carrying nonequilibrium steady state and the transition regions in a family of models including the Lieb-Liniger model of interacting Bose gases, realized in experiments.},

	abstract = {We review the recent theoretical and experimental progress regarding the generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) behavior of the one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas with contact repulsive interactions, also known as the Lieb–Liniger gas. In the first section, we review the theory of the Lieb–Liniger gas, introducing the key notions of the rapidities and of the rapidity distribution. The latter characterizes the Lieb–Liniger gas after relaxation and is at the heart of GHD. We also present the asymptotic regimes of the Lieb–Liniger gas with their dedicated approximate descriptions. In the second section we enter the core of the subject and review the theoretical results of GHD in 1D Bose gases. The third and fourth sections are dedicated to experimental results obtained in cold atom experiments: the experimental realization of the Lieb–Liniger model is presented in section 3, with a selection of key results for systems at equilibrium, and section 4 presents the experimental tests of the GHD theory. In section 5 we review the effects of atom losses, which, assuming slow loss processes, can be described within the GHD framework. We conclude with a few open questions.},

All the eigenfunctions can be found explicitly and the energies are given by the solutions of a transcendental equation. The problem has one nontrivial coupling constant, γ.

In this paper, we explicitly calculate the ground-state energy as a function of γ and show that it is analytic for all γ, except γ=0. In Part II, we discuss the excitation spectrum and show that it is most convenient to regard it as a double spectrum—not one as is ordinarily supposed.},

	abstract = {The singularities of the dynamical response function are one of the most remarkable effects in many-body interacting systems. However in one dimension these divergences only exist strictly at zero temperature, making their observation very difficult in most cold atomic experimental settings. Moreover the presence of a finite temperature destroys another feature of one-dimensional quantum liquids: the real space quasilong-range order in which the spatial correlation functions exhibit power-law decay. We consider a nonequilibrium protocol where two interacting Bose gases are prepared either at different temperatures or chemical potentials and then joined. We show that the nonequilibrium steady state emerging at large times around the junction displays edge singularities in the response function and quasilong-range order.},

	abstract = {One-dimensional Bose gases with contact repulsive interactions are characterized by the presence of infinite-lifetime quasiparticles whose momenta are called the “rapidities.” Here, we develop a probe of the local rapidity distribution, based on the fact that rapidities are the asymptotic momenta of the particles after a long one-dimensional expansion. This is done by performing an expansion of a selected slice of the gas. We first apply this idea to a cloud in the quasicondensate regime at equilibrium in a trap. We obtain an experimental picture of the position-dependent rapidity distribution which is in fair agreement with the theory prediction. The asymptotic regime is barely reached, but we show that finite expansion time can be taken into account using the generalized hydrodynamics theory. We then apply this local probe to an out-of-equilibrium situation where the local rapidity distribution is expected to be doubly peaked—a hallmark of a nonthermal state—even though the global rapidity distribution would possess no such distinctive feature. We observe the doubly peaked local rapidity distribution.},
