\section{Trapped surfaces and singularity theorems}

\subsection{Trapped surfaces} \label{s:loc:trapped_surf}

The concept of trapped surfaces has been introduced in Sec.~\ref{s:neh:trapped_surfaces}
(see in particular Fig.~\ref{f:neh:trapped_surf}). Let us recall that
a submanifold $\Sp$ of a $n$-dimensional spacetime $(\M, \w{g})$ ($n\ge 3$) is
a \defin{trapped surface}\index{trapped!surface} iff (i) $\Sp$ is a compact $(n-2)$-dimensional manifold
(without boundary), (ii) $\Sp$ is spacelike (positive definite induced metric)
and the two systems of null geodesics emerging orthogonally from $\Sp$ towards the future
locally converge, i.e. they have negative expansions at $\Sp$:
$\theta_{(\wl)} < 0$ and $\theta_{(\w{k})} < 0$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:def_trapped_surf})],
$\wl$ and $\w{k}$ being
any future-directed vectors tangent to these geodesics.

\begin{remark}
Trapped surfaces are sometimes called
\emph{closed trapped surfaces}\index{closed!trapped surface}\index{trapped!surface!closed --} (e.g. \cite{Penro65,HawkiE73}),
to stress their closed manifold aspect (compact without boundary).
We follow here the textbooks \cite{MisneTW73,Wald84} and call them merely
\emph{trapped surfaces}.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}[trapped surfaces in the Schwarzschild spacetime]
\label{x:loc:trapped_surf_Schwarz}
Let $(\M,\w{g})$ be the Schwarzschild spacetime as defined in Sec.~\ref{s:sch:time_orientation} [Eq.~(\ref{s:sch:def_Schwarz_spacetime})]; it is entirely covered by the ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates
$(\ti,r,\th,\ph)$. Let $\Sp$ be any surface $(\ti,r) = \mathrm{const}$.
$\Sp$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^2$ and thus compact.
Moreover, from Eq.~(\ref{e:sch:Schwarz_metric_EF}), the metric induced by $\w{g}$
on $\Sp$ is $\w{q} = r^2 (\dd\th^2 + \sin^2\th\,\dd\ph^2)$, which is clearly positive definite;
hence $\Sp$ is spacelike. One also reads on the expression of $\w{q}$
that the area of  $\Sp$ is simply $A = 4\pi r^2$ (i.e. $r$ is the areal radius, cf. Sec.~\ref{s:sch:static_spher}).
If $\Sp$ is located in the black hole interior, i.e. if $0<r < 2m$,
Property~\ref{p:sch:r_decreasing} implies that $A$ is decreasing along any future-directed null
geodesic. It follows that $\Sp$ is trapped. On the contrary, if located in the black hole exterior
($r> 2m$), $\Sp$ is untrapped. This can be checked on Fig.~\ref{f:sch:rad_null_geod_EF},
where it appears clearly that, in the region $r>2m$, $r$ is increasing along the outgoing radial null geodesics, which are normal to $\Sp$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[trapped surfaces in the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse]
\label{x:loc:trapped_surf_OS}
Spherically symmetric trapped surfaces in the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse
have been investigated in Sec.~\ref{s:lem:trapped} (in particular, see Fig.~\ref{f:lem:OS:diag_trapped}): in terms of the FLRW coordinates $(\eta,\chi,\th,\ph)$
spanning the collapsing star
[cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:lem:OS:g_int})], they are all the spheres $(\eta,\chi) = \mathrm{const}$
such that $\eta > \pi - 2 \chi$ (Property~\ref{p:lem:trapped_surfaces}). Outside
the collapsing star, i.e. in the Schwarzschild region [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:lem:OS:exterior_metric})], they are all the spheres
$(\ti,r) = \mathrm{const}$ with $r< 2m$ (cf. Example~\ref{x:loc:trapped_surf_Schwarz}).
\end{example}

\begin{example}[trapped surfaces in the Vaidya collapse]
\label{x:loc:trapped_surf_Vaidya}
Spherically symmetric trapped surfaces in the Vaidya radiation shell collapse
have been investigated in Sec.~\ref{s:vai:trapped_surf}: in terms of the
IEF coordinates $(t,r,\th,\ph)$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:vai:metric_IEF})],
they are the spheres $(t,r) = \mathrm{const}$
such that $r < 2M(t+r)$ (Property~\ref{p:vai:trapped_surfaces}).
The region containing them is depicted as red dot-filled
in the Carter-Penrose diagrams of Figs.~\ref{f:vai:CPdiag_thin}, \ref{f:vai:CPdiag_nk_sing}
and \ref{f:vai:CPdiag_Cauchy}.
\end{example}


\begin{figure}

of light rays are converging. Yet $\Sp$ is not trapped because it is not compact.

\end{figure}

The existence of a trapped surface characterizes
strong gravity\index{gravity!strong --}. More precisely it indicates that gravity is strong enough
to focus all light rays emitted from the surface.
This characterization is \emph{quasi-local}\index{quasi-local}, in the sense that it involves a \emph{surface}. The
surface can be ``small'' but it cannot be reduced to a point, to which the qualifier \emph{local}
would apply. Note that the hypothesis of \emph{compact} manifold is crucial in the definition of a
trapped surface. Without it, trapped surfaces would exist in Minkowski
spacetime, as the following example shows.

\begin{example}[a counter-example in Minkowski spacetime]
Let us consider the intersection $\Sp$ of the past light cones $\mathscr{C}_p$ and $\mathscr{C}_q$
of two points $p$ and $q$ in Minkowski spacetime (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:loc:cone_intersect}).
Being a cross-section of the null hypersurface $\mathscr{C}_p$ (or $\mathscr{C}_q$),
$\Sp$ is a spacelike surface (Property~\ref{p:def:spacelike_cs}).
Moreover the null directions $\w{k}$ and $\wl$ normal to it are given by the null generators of
$\mathscr{C}_p$ (since $\Sp$ is a cross-section of $\mathscr{C}_p$)
and of $\mathscr{C}_q$ (since $\Sp$ is a cross-section of $\mathscr{C}_q$).
Because $\mathscr{C}_p$ and $\mathscr{C}_q$ are past light cones, one has clearly
$\theta_{(\wl)} < 0$ and $\theta_{(\w{k})} < 0$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:loc:cone_intersect}).
However, $\Sp$ fails to be a trapped surface for it is not compact. Truncating the light cones
would not help, because this would make $\Sp$ a manifold with boundary and hence not a closed one.
\end{example}

It is worth noticing that some (peculiar) black hole spacetimes
do not contain any trapped surface in the strict sense ($\theta_{(\w{k})} < 0$ and $\theta_{(\wl)} < 0$), but only \emph{marginally trapped surfaces}\index{marginally!trapped surface}\index{trapped!surface!marginally --} ($\theta_{(\w{k})} < 0$ and $\theta_{(\wl)} = 0$).
This is demonstrated by the following example:

\begin{example}[no trapped surface in the extremal Reissner-Nordström spacetime]
The \defin{extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole}\index{Reissner-Nordström!black hole!extremal --}\index{extremal!Reissner-Nordström!black hole}\index{extremal!Reissner-Nordström!spacetime} is defined by setting
$Q = \sqrt{4\pi/\mu_0}\, M$ and $P=0$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:ReiNor_n4}). Performing the
change of notation
$M\to m$, this yields the metric
\be \label{e:loc:metric_ERN}
    \w{g}  =  -\left( 1 - \frac{m}{r} \right)^2 \dd t^2
    + \left( 1 - \frac{m}{r}  \right) ^{-2} \dd r^2
     + r^2 \left( \dd\th^2 + \sin^2\th\, \dd\ph^2 \right) .
\ee
The coordinates $(t,r,\th,\ph)$ are singular at $r=m$. One can introduce
Eddington-Finkelstein-like coordinates $(\ti,r,\th,\ph)$ via
\be
    \ti := t + 2 m \ln \left| \frac{r}{m} - 1 \right| + \frac{m}{1 - r/m}
\ee
(compare with Eq.~(\ref{e:sch:ti_t_r}) in the Schwarzschild case)
to get a regular coordinate system
in the whole range $r\in(0, +\infty)$. The hypersurface $\Hor$ defined by $r=m$ appears then as
a black hole event horizon. $\Hor$ is
a \emph{degenerate} Killing horizon\index{degenerate!Killing horizon}\index{Killing!horizon!degenerate --} with respect to the Killing vector $\w{\xi} = \wpar_t = \wpar_{\ti}$
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:neh:classif_KH}) ({\emph Exercise:} prove it!). This is similar to
the event horizon
of the extremal Kerr spacetime (cf. Chap.~\ref{s:exk}), which is a degenerate Killing horizon
as well (Property~\ref{p:exk:H_degenerate_KH}).
From the metric (\ref{e:loc:metric_ERN}), it
appears that the vector field $\wpar_t$ is timelike in both regions $r<m$
(black hole interior)
and $r>m$ (black hole exterior), since $g_{tt} < 0$ there.
Moreover, for the standard time orientation given by $\wpar_{\ti}$,
$\wpar_t$ is future-directed in these two regions.
Let us consider a 2-sphere $\Sp$ defined by $(t,r) = \mathrm{const}$
with $r\neq m$. The two families of null geodesics $\Li_{\pm}$ normal to $\Sp$ are
ruled by the equations $(\th,\ph) = \mathrm{const}$ and
\be \label{e:loc:radial_geod_ERN}
    \left. \derd{r}{t} \right| _{\Li_{\pm}}= \pm \left( 1  - \frac{m}{r} \right) ^2 .
\ee
This last equation is deduced from Eq.~(\ref{e:loc:metric_ERN})
by setting $\D s^2 := \w{g}(\D\w{x},\D\w{x}) = 0$ with
$\D\w{x} = \D t \, \wpar_t + \D r \, \wpar_r$ along $\Li_{\pm}$.
One reads on the metric (\ref{e:loc:metric_ERN}) that the area of $\Sp$ is
$A=4\pi r^2$, as in the Schwarzschild case (Example~\ref{x:loc:trapped_surf_Schwarz}).
Now, since $\wpar_t$ is future-directed timelike, it appears from Eq.~(\ref{e:loc:radial_geod_ERN}) that $r$ increases (resp. decreases)
towards to the future along $\Li_+$ (resp. $\Li_-$), in both regions $r<m$ and $r>m$. It
follows immediately that $\Sp$ is not trapped. Actually, there exists only
\emph{marginally} trapped surfaces in this spacetime: the cross-sections of
the event horizon $\Hor$.
\end{example}

\subsection{Penrose's singularity theorem}

Trapped surfaces are the key ingredient of Penrose's singularity theorem,
which basically states that, under some rather generic assumptions, if gravity is
strong enough so that a trapped surface occurs, then some singularity will
appear in the future of it.
Before stating the theorem, let us recall a few concepts on which it relies.

First of all, a \defin{Cauchy surface}\index{Cauchy!surface}
$\Sigma$ of a spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ is a spacelike
hypersurface such that every inextendible timelike curve of $\M$
intersects $\Sigma$ exactly once (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:sta:BH_stationary}). If $(\M,\w{g})$
admits a Cauchy surface, it is said to be a
\defin{globally hyperbolic}\index{globally!hyperbolic} spacetime.
On such a spacetime, general relativity can be formulated as a well posed
Cauchy problem \cite{ChoquG69},
i.e. there exists a unique solution $\w{g}$ of the Einstein equation
in $\M$ from initial data prescribed on $\Sigma$, provided that the initial data
fulfill four components of the Einstein equation known as the
\emph{constraint equations}\index{constraint equations}
(see e.g. Ref.~\cite{Gourg12}).

The second concept involved in Penrose's theorem is that of
an \emph{inextendible incomplete} geodesic. As defined in
Appendix~\ref{s:geo} (Sec.~\ref{s:geo:existence_uniqueness}), a
geodesic $\Li$ of a spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ is \defin{incomplete}\index{incomplete geodesic}\index{geodesic!incomplete --} if some affine parameter $\lambda$ does not
span the whole of $\R$ along $\Li$.
Given that any two affine parameters are related by
an affine transformation, if this holds for a given affine parameter, this holds for all.
More precisely, if $\Li$ is a causal (i.e. timelike or null) geodesic and $\lambda$ is increasing to the future, one says that $\Li$
is \defin{future-incomplete}\index{future!incomplete geodesic}\index{geodesic!future-incomplete --}\index{incomplete!future -- geodesic} if, and only if, $\lambda < \lambda_{\rm max}$
along $\Li$, for some $\lambda_{\rm max}\in\R$.
Similarly, one says that $\Li$
is \defin{past-incomplete}\index{past!incomplete geodesic}\index{geodesic!past-incomplete --}\index{incomplete!past -- geodesic} if, and only if,
$\lambda > \lambda_{\rm min}$ along $\Li$, for some $\lambda_{\rm min}\in\R$.
Furthermore, a geodesic $\Li$ is said \defin{inextendible}\index{inextendible geodesic}\index{geodesic!inextendible --} if, and only if,
there does not exist any geodesic $\Li'$ of $(\M,\w{g})$ distinct from $\Li$
and such that $\Li\subset\Li'$. An inextendible incomplete causal geodesic
marks the existence of a singularity\index{singularity} of some kind.
For instance a free-falling observer having an
inextendible future-incomplete timelike geodesic as worldline has his proper time\footnote{Recall that
the proper time is an affine parameter along a timelike geodesic (Property~\ref{p:geo:proper_time_affine}).} abruptly
stopping at some finite value!
Actually, the existence of an inextendible incomplete geodesic is the
nowadays adopted definition of a \defin{spacetime singularity}\index{spacetime!singularity}\index{singularity!spacetime --}. We shall discuss the connection with the concept of \emph{curvature singularity}
introduced in Sec.~\ref{s:sch:singularities} later on.
For the moment, we have enough material
to state the famous theorem:

\begin{prop}[Penrose's singularity theorem\index{Penrose!singularity theorem}\index{singularity!Penrose's -- theorem} \textnormal{(Penrose\index[pers]{Penrose, R.}  1965 \cite{Penro65})}]
\label{p:loc:Penrose_sing_thm}
Let $(\M,\w{g})$ be a $n$-dimensional time-orientable spacetime ($n\ge 3$) such that
\begin{itemize}
\item $(\M,\w{g})$ admits a non-compact Cauchy surface $\Sigma$;
\item the null convergence condition\index{null!convergence condition}\index{convergence!condition!null --} (\ref{e:neh:null_energy_cond}) holds on $\M$:
for any null vector $\wl$, $\w{R}(\wl, \wl) \geq 0$, where $\w{R}$ is
$\w{g}$'s Ricci tensor --- for general relativity, such a condition is
equivalent to the null energy condition\index{null!energy condition}\index{energy!condition!null --} (\ref{e:neh:null_energy_cond_matter}):
$\w{T}(\wl, \wl) \geq 0$;
\item there exists a trapped surface $\Sp$.
\end{itemize}
Then at least one inextendible null geodesic emerging orthogonally from $\Sp$
is future-incomplete.
\end{prop}

\end{figure}



\begin{proof}
We shall prove the theorem by contradiction. Hence let us assume that all
inextendible null geodesics emerging orthogonally from $\Sp$ are future-complete. Let $\mathscr{F}$
be the boundary of the causal future of $\Sp$
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:glo:causal_struct} and Fig.~\ref{f:loc:penrose_thm}): $\mathscr{F} := \partial J^+(\Sp)$.
Since $(\M,\w{g})$ is globally hyperbolic (it admits $\Sigma$ as a Cauchy surface),
it is necessarily causally simple\index{causally simple}\index{simple!causally --}
(cf. Proposition~6.6.1 of HE \cite{HawkiE73}).
By the very definition of \emph{causally simple}
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:glo:causal_struct}) and the compacity of $\Sp$, it follows that
$\mathscr{F}$ coincides with the future horismos\index{future!horismos}\index{horismos} of $\Sp$:
$\mathscr{F} = E^+(\Sp)$. This implies that points of $\mathscr{F}$ are connected to $\Sp$
by null geodesics. More precisely, we note that
$\mathscr{F}$ is an \emph{achronal boundary}\index{achronal!boundary}\index{boundary!achronal},
namely the boundary of the causal future or past of a given set.
As mentioned in Sec.~\ref{s:glo:properties_H} (Remark~\ref{r:glo:achronal_boundaries}),
the properties of achronal boundaries are the same as those established for a black hole event horizon
$\Hor = \partial J^-(\scri^+) \cap \M$ (Properties~\ref{p:glo:prop1} to \ref{p:glo:prop4}),
provided one changes \emph{future} to \emph{past} when appropriate.
It follows that $\mathscr{F}$ is an achronal $(n-1)$-dimensional topological manifold
(Properties~\ref{p:glo:prop1} and \ref{p:glo:prop2}) that is ruled by null geodesics,
called the \emph{generators}\index{generator!of an achronal boundary} of $\mathscr{F}$ and
obeying the following properties:
when followed in the past direction, a generator never leaves $\mathscr{F}$ until it encounters $\Sp$
and there is a unique generator through each point of $\mathscr{F}$, except at special
points, named \emph{crossovers}\index{crossover point}, where the generators leave
$\mathscr{F}$ in the future direction,
i.e. are future-extended to null geodesics of $\M$ that do not belong\footnote{They actually
belong to the interior of $J^+(\Sp)$, i.e. to the chronological future $I^+(\Sp)$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:glo:int_JS_IS})] (see e.g. Proposition~4.5.14 in HE~\cite{HawkiE73}).}
to $\mathscr{F}$ (Property~\ref{p:glo:prop3}). Note that two crossovers are shown in
Fig.~\ref{f:loc:penrose_thm}.

We actually need an additional property of $\mathscr{F}$,
which has not been established in Sec.~\ref{s:glo:properties_H}:
on  $\Sp$ (which is part of $\mathscr{F}$, cf. Sec.~\ref{s:glo:causal_struct}),
the generators of $\mathscr{F}$ are orthogonal to $\Sp$ (cf. e.g. Theorem~9.3.11
in Wald's textbook~\cite{Wald84}). They therefore start from $\Sp$ along
the two null directions $\wl$ and $\w{k}$ normal to $\Sp$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:loc:penrose_thm}). Let us denote by $\Li$ a generic null
generator along $\wl$ and by $\lambda$ the affine parameter of $\Li$
such that, on $\Sp$, $\lambda = 0$ and $\left. \D\w{x}/\D\lambda\right| _\Li = \wl$. We shall use
the latter relation to extend the definition of $\wl$ along $\Li$
away from $\Sp$. Similarly, let us denote by $\bar{\Li}$ a generic null
generator along $\w{k}$ and by $\bar\lambda$ the affine parameter of $\bar{\Li}$
such that $\bar\lambda = 0$ on $\Sp$ and
$\left. \D\w{x}/\D\bar\lambda \right| _{\bar{\Li}}= \w{k}$.
By hypothesis, $\Li$ and $\bar{\Li}$ are future-complete.
Since $\Sp$ is a trapped surface, $\theta_0 := \left. \theta_{(\wl)} \right| _{\Sp} < 0$
and $\bar\theta_0 := \left. \theta_{(\w{k})} \right|_{\Sp}<0$.
Then, the
null Raychaudhuri equation\index{null!Raychaudhuri equation}\index{Raychaudhuri!null --  equation}
(\ref{e:def:null_Raychaud_Ricci}) applied to the null hypersurface
generated by the null geodesics of the $\Li$ family and
the null convergence condition $\w{R}(\wl,\wl) \geq 0$ implies that there exists $\lambda_* \in (0, (n-2)/|\theta_0|]$
such that $\theta_{(\wl)} \to -\infty$ for $\lambda\to \lambda_*$ along $\Li$.
The reasoning is exactly the same at that used in the proof of
Property~\ref{p:evo:positive_expansion} and we shall
not repeat it here. The point $\lambda=\lambda_*$ on $\Li$ is a caustic point,
where all nearby geodesics starting from $\Sp$ along $\wl$ converge.
Given the properties of $\mathscr{F}$, we conclude that for $\lambda > \lambda_*$, $\Li$
ceases to a be null generator of $\mathscr{F}$, i.e.
$\Li_{\lambda > \lambda_*} \not\in \mathscr{F}$.
Similarly, along $\bar{\Li}$,
$\theta_{(\w{k})} \to -\infty$ for $\bar\lambda\to \bar\lambda_*$
with $\bar\lambda_* \in (0, (n-2)/|\bar\theta_0|]$, so that
$\bar{\Li}_{\bar\lambda > \bar\lambda_*} \not\in \mathscr{F}$.
Let
\[
    \lambda_{\rm max} := \sup_{p\in\Sp} \left(  \frac{n-2}{|\theta_{(\wl)} (p)|} \right)
    \qand
    \bar\lambda_{\rm max} := \sup_{p\in\Sp} \left(  \frac{n-2}{|\bar\theta_{(\w{k})}(p)|} \right)    .
\]
Since $\Sp$ is compact, $\lambda_{\rm max}$ and $\bar\lambda_{\rm max}$ are finite.
Let us then consider the map $f: \Sp \times [0,\lambda_{\rm max}] \to \M$,
$(p,\lambda) \mapsto q$, where $q$ is the point of affine parameter $\lambda$
on the null geodesic of the $\Li$-family through $p$.
Since all the $\Li$ geodesics are assumed to be future-complete, $f$ is well defined.
Moreover, $f$ is clearly continuous. Then, given that
$\Sp \times [0,\lambda_{\rm max}]$ is a compact set, the image set
$f(\Sp \times [0,\lambda_{\rm max}])$ is necessarily compact. Similarly, the image set
$\bar{f}(\Sp \times [0,\bar\lambda_{\rm max}])$ is compact, where
$\bar{f}: \Sp \times [0,\bar\lambda_{\rm max}] \to \M$, $(p,\lambda) \mapsto \bar{q}$ --- the point of affine parameter $\bar\lambda$
on the null geodesic of the $\bar{\Li}$-family through $p$.
The set
\[
    \mathscr{V} := f\left(\Sp \times [0,\lambda_{\rm max}]\right)
        \cup \bar{f}\left(\Sp \times [0,\bar\lambda_{\rm max}]\right)
\]
is then a compact subset of $\M$, as the union of two such sets. By construction, for each $p\in\Sp$, the
point $q = f(p,\lambda_{\rm max})$ (resp. $\bar{q} = f(p,\lambda_{\rm max})$)
lies beyond the caustic point on the geodesic $\Li$ (resp. $\bar{\Li}$)
through $p$. It follows that $\mathscr{F} \subset \mathscr{V}$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:loc:penrose_thm}).
Given that $\mathscr{F}$
is closed, being a topological boundary ($\mathscr{F} := \partial J^+(\Sp)$),
and $\mathscr{V}$ is compact, we conclude that $\mathscr{F}$ is compact.

Because $(\M,\w{g})$ is time-orientable, there exists a nonvanishing
timelike vector field $\w{\xi}$ on $\M$. The field lines of $\w{\xi}$
form a congruence of timelike curves $\mathscr{C}$, each of them intersecting
$\Sigma$ in a single point, for $\Sigma$ is a Cauchy surface.
We may then define a map $\Phi: \mathscr{F} \to \Sigma$,
$p \mapsto \mathscr{C}_p \cap \Sigma$, where $\mathscr{C}_p$ is the unique
timelike curve of the $\mathscr{C}$ congruence through $p$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:loc:penrose_thm}).
The map $\Phi$ is clearly continuous. Moreover, it is injective given that
$\mathscr{F}$ is achronal (if a point $q\in\Sigma$ was the image of two distinct
points $p$ and $p'$ of $\mathscr{F}$, this would mean that $p$ and $p'$
are connected by a timelike curve, namely a segment of $\mathscr{C}_p$).
Now, there cannot be any injective continuous map from a
compact manifold (without boundary) (here $\mathscr{F}$)
into a non-compact manifold of the same dimension (here $\Sigma$). For instance,
there is no injective continuous map from the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ into
the plane $\R^2$. To show this impossibility in the present case, and hence
to reach the sought contradiction, let us invoke a
standard topology theorem (see e.g. Lemma~4.50
in Lee's textbook~\cite{Lee11}), according to which an injective continuous map
from a compact space to a Hausdorff space
is a topological embedding, i.e. a homeomorphism onto its image. This theorem applies here
since $\Sigma$ is Hausdorff, being a manifold (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:def_manif}).
Hence $\Phi(\mathscr{F})$ is homeomorphic to $\mathscr{F}$.
$\Phi(\mathscr{F})$ is therefore a compact subset of $\Sigma$.
Another standard result of topology (see e.g. Proposition 4.36b in Lee's textbook~\cite{Lee11})
states that a compact subset of a Hausdorff space is closed. Hence $\Phi(\mathscr{F})$
is a closed subset of $\Sigma$.
On the other side, since $\mathscr{F}$ is a $(n-1)$-dimensional topological manifold,
each point of $\mathscr{F}$
has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of $\R^{n-1}$. The same feature holds then for
$\Phi(\mathscr{F})$. Since $\Sigma$ is a $(n-1)$-dimensional manifold, it follows that
$\Phi(\mathscr{F})$ is an open subset of $\Sigma$. Hence $\Phi(\mathscr{F})$ is both open
and closed in $\Sigma$. Given that $\Sigma$ is connected, being a Cauchy surface in
a connected spacetime, this implies that
$\Phi(\mathscr{F}) = \Sigma$. Here we reach a contradiction because $\Sigma$
is assumed non-compact.
\end{proof}

It is worth to stress that Penrose's singularity theorem is \emph{not}
telling that a \emph{curvature} singularity\index{curvature!singularity}\index{singularity!curvature --}, as described in Sec.~\ref{s:sch:singularities},
must exist in spacetime (or at some ``boundary'' of it, since
curvature singularities are usually excluded from the spacetime manifold).
The theorem only stipulates that some inextendible null geodesic is future-incomplete. However,
a good reason for a null geodesic to be future-incomplete is to hit a curvature singularity
as the examples below are going to illustrate.

Another cause of incompleteness could be
that the geodesic, $\Li$ say, has reached some regular ``external boundary'' $\Hor$
of the spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$
and both $\M$ and $\w{g}$ can be smoothly extended beyond this boundary, i.e.
there exists a spacetime $(\tilde{\M}, \w{\tilde{g}})$ such that $\M \subset \tilde{\M}$
and $\left. \w{\tilde{g}} \right| _{\M} = \w{g}$. The boundary $\Hor$, which is a part of
$\tilde{\M}$, not of $\M$ (for $\M$ is a manifold without boundary), is then the
\emph{future Cauchy horizon}\index{future!Cauchy!horizon}\index{Cauchy!horizon}\index{horizon!Cauchy --}  of the hypersurface $\Sigma$
in $\tilde{\M}$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:ker:Cauchy_hor}).
Note that since $\Sigma$ is a Cauchy surface of $(\M,\w{g})$,
$\Sigma$ has no Cauchy horizon within $\M$. With respect to $(\tilde{\M}, \w{\tilde{g}})$,
$\Sigma$ is only a \emph{partial} Cauchy surface\index{partial!Cauchy surface}\index{Cauchy!surface!partial --} (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:ker:Cauchy_hor}
and Fig.~\ref{f:ker:cauchy_hor}).
The geodesic $\Li$, which was inextendible within $\M$, can then be extended beyond
$\Hor$ in a possibly complete geodesic of $(\tilde{\M},\w{\tilde{g}})$ and
there might be no curvature singularity at all in the spacetime $(\tilde{\M},\w{\tilde{g}})$.

\begin{example}[Schwarzschild spacetime]
\label{x:loc:Penrose_thm_Schwarz}
Let us consider the maximally extended Schwarzschild spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$
discussed in Chap.~\ref{s:max}.
The hypersurface $\Sigma$ defined by $T=0$ in terms of the Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates
$(T,X,\th,\ph)$ is a non-compact Cauchy surface of $(\M,\w{g})$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:sch:kruskal_diag}
or Fig.~\ref{f:max:carter-penrose-FN}).
The null convergence condition
is trivially fulfilled since the Ricci tensor $\w{R}$
is identically zero, $\w{g}$ being a solution of the vacuum Einstein equation
(\ref{e:fra:vac_Einstein}). As detailled in Example~\ref{x:loc:trapped_surf_Schwarz}
(p.~\pageref{x:loc:trapped_surf_Schwarz}), any sphere $\Sp$ defined
by $(\ti,r) = \mathrm{const}$ is a trapped surface in the region $r<2 m$
of the ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein patch, i.e. the region $\M_{\rm II}$.
All the hypotheses of Penrose's singularity theorem are then fulfilled,
so there must exist an incomplete null geodesic emerging from $\Sp$.
Actually, all null geodesics emerging orthogonally from $\Sp$ are incomplete,
for they all reach the curvature singularity $r=0$ within a finite affine
parameter, as it appears clearly in Fig.~\ref{f:sch:rad_null_geod_KS}
(remember that $r$ is an affine parameter along these geodesics, cf.
Property~\ref{p:sch:radial_null_geod}).
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse]
\label{x:loc:Penrose_thm_OS}
The gravitational collapse of a homogeneous pressureless ball, as
described by the Oppenheimer-Snyder model discussed in Sec.~\ref{s:lem:OS},
provides an example of a dynamical spacetime illustrating
Penrose's theorem.
The hypersurface $\Sigma$ defined by $\ti=0$ in terms of the global
IEF coordinates $(\ti, r, \th, \ph)$ is a non-compact Cauchy surface of
the underlying spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ (cf. the Carter-Penrose diagram
of Fig.~\ref{f:lem:OS:CP_diag}). Since $\w{g}$ is a solution of the Einstein
equation, the null convergence condition reduces to the null energy condition:
$\w{T}(\wl,\wl) \geq 0$ for any null vector $\wl$.  Given the form
(\ref{e:lem:T_pressureless}) of the energy-momentum tensor $\w{T}$, we get,
inside the collapsing star,
$\w{T}(\wl,\wl) = \rho (\w{u}\cdot\wl)^2 > 0$ since $\rho > 0$, while
$\w{T}(\wl,\wl) = 0$ outside the star. Hence the null convergence condition
is fulfilled. Finally, as detailed in Example~\ref{x:loc:trapped_surf_OS}
(p.~\pageref{x:loc:trapped_surf_OS}), this spacetime contains trapped surfaces.
All the hypotheses of Penrose's singularity theorem are thus satisfied.
Let us check its predictions on the two families $\Li$ and $\bar{\Li}$
of null geodesics emanating orthogonally from a trapped
sphere $\Sp$ that is defined in terms of the conformal coordinates
$(\eta,\chi,\th,\ph)$ by $(\eta,\chi) = (\eta_0,\chi_0) = \mathrm{const}$,
with
$\pi - \eta_0 < \chi_0 < \chi_{\rm s} - (\pi - \eta_0)$. This constraint implies
that both $\Li$ and $\bar{\Li}$
stay in the interior of the collapsing star until they reach
the curvature singularity $\eta=\pi$ (cf. the conformal diagram in
Fig.~\ref{f:lem:OS:diag_int_EF} left). Let us check that this happens for
a finite value of their affine parameters. The equation of these geodesics
is easily deduced from the conformal form (\ref{e:lem:OS:g_int}) of the metric tensor:
we get $\eta - \eta_0 = \pm (\chi - \chi_0)$ with $\pm = +$
for $\Li$ and $\pm = -$ for $\bar{\Li}$.
Moreover, $\eta$ is an affine parameter
along both $\Li$ and $\bar{\Li}$ with respect to the conformal metric
 $\w{h} := - \dd\eta^2 + \dd\chi^2
        + \sin^2\chi \left( \dd\th^2 + \sin^2\th\, \dd\ph^2 \right)$.
According to Eq.~(\ref{e:glo:conf_transf_null_geod}) any affine parameter $\lambda$
of $\Li$ or $\bar{\Li}$ with respect to the physical metric $\w{g}$ is related
to the $\w{h}$-affine parameter $\eta$ by $\D\lambda/\D\eta = a \Omega^2$, where $a$
is a positive constant and the
conformal factor $\Omega$ is read on Eq.~(\ref{e:lem:OS:g_int}):
$\Omega^2 = (a_0/2)^2 (1 + \cos\eta)^2$. The integration leads to
\[
    \lambda = \alpha \left( 6 \eta + 8 \sin\eta + \sin 2\eta \right) + \beta ,
\]
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are two constants such that $\alpha>0$. We have then
$\lim_{\eta\to\pi} \lambda = 6\alpha\pi + \beta$, which is obviously finite. We conclude that
both $\Li$ and $\bar{\Li}$ are future-incomplete.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Vaidya collapse]
\label{x:loc:Penrose_thm_Vaidya}
Let us consider the collapse of a radiation shell
as studied in Sec.~\ref{s:vai:infall}, assuming that the shell is thin
(large radiation density): $\alpha := 2m/v_0 > 1/8$
[cf. Eqs.~(\ref{e:vai:def_alpha}) and (\ref{e:vai:v0_small})].
As it can be inferred from the Carter-Penrose diagram of Fig.~\ref{f:vai:CPdiag_thin},
a hypersurface $t=\mathrm{const}$ in the black hole exterior
is a non-compact Cauchy surface (for instance the hypersurface $t=-3m$ in
the $\alpha=2/3$ model considered in Fig.~\ref{f:vai:diag_S0}).
Besides, we have already noticed in Sec.~\ref{s:vai:general} that the null energy
condition is fulfilled, for $M(v)$ is an increasing function (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:vai:mass_function}).
Finally, as detailed in Example~\ref{x:loc:trapped_surf_Vaidya}
(p.~\pageref{x:loc:trapped_surf_Vaidya}), trapped surfaces forms in the late
stages of the collapse.
Penrose's singularity theorem thus applies and there should be
an incomplete inextendible null geodesic emerging from each trapped sphere $\Sp$
described in Example~\ref{x:loc:trapped_surf_Vaidya}.
It is easy to show that this is indeed the case for all ingoing null geodesics\footnote{All outgoing
null geodesics from $\Sp$ are also incomplete, but this is harder to show for there is no simple
expression of an affine parameter along them.}
$\bar{\Li} = \Li^{\rm in}_{(v,\th,\ph)}$, i.e. geodesics emerging from $\Sp$ along the vector $\w{k}$
normal to the null hypersurfaces $v=\mathrm{const}$ (cf. Property~\ref{p:vai:null_hyp_v_const}).
As it is clear on Fig.~\ref{f:vai:CPdiag_thin}, all the geodesics $\Li^{\rm in}_{(v,\th,\ph)}$
terminate at the curvature singularity $r=0$, $v>0$. Since $-r$ is an affine parameter along
them (Property~\ref{p:vai:source_Vaidya_metric}), we conclude that they are future-incomplete.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Bardeen regular black hole as a counter-example]
\label{x:loc:Bardeen_BH}
There exist solutions of the Einstein equation (with some rather exotic matter sources)
corresponding to a black hole
without any curvature singularity. They are called \defin{regular black holes}\index{regular black hole}\index{black!hole!regular --} (see e.g. the recent book~\cite{Bambi23}).
A well known example (historically the first one)
is the \defin{Bardeen black hole}\index{Bardeen black hole}
\cite{Barde68} (see also Sec.~V of Ref.~\cite{Borde94}). The underlying spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$
is static and spherically symmetric; in some part of it, the metric is
expressed in terms of the Schwarzschild-Droste-like coordinates $(t,r,\th,\ph)$
by
\be \label{e:loc:Bardeen_metric}
 \w{g} = -\left( 1 - \frac{2 M(r)}{r} \right)\, \dd t^2
            + \left( 1 - \frac{2 M(r)}{r} \right) ^{-1}\, \dd r^2 +
        r^2 \left( \dd\th^2 + \sin^2\th\, \dd\ph^2 \right) ,
\ee
where
\be
    M(r) := m \frac{r^3}{(r^2 + \ell^2)^{3/2}} ,
\ee
$m$ and $\ell$ being two positive constants obeying $\ell < 4m/(3\sqrt{3})$.
Would $M(r)$ be a constant function, one would get the Schwarzschild metric (\ref{e:sch:Schwarz_metric_SD}). Actually the Schwarzschild metric is recovered
asymptotically, since $M(r) \to  m$ for $r\to +\infty$. For small values of $r$,
one has instead
\be
    M(r) \underset{r\to 0}{\sim} \frac{m}{\ell^3} r^3 .
\ee
This implies that $\w{g}$ is regular at $r=0$, contrary to the Schwarzschild metric.
More precisely, setting $\Lambda := 6m/\ell^3$, we get
\be
\w{g} \underset{r\to 0}{\sim}  -\left( 1 - \frac{\Lambda}{3} r^2 \right)\, \dd t^2
            + \left( 1 - \frac{\Lambda}{3} r^2  \right) ^{-1}\, \dd r^2 +
        r^2 \left( \dd\th^2 + \sin^2\th\, \dd\ph^2 \right) .
\ee
We recognize in the right-hand side the metric of de Sitter spacetime\index{de Sitter spacetime}
of cosmological constant $\Lambda$
expressed in the so-called static coordinates (see e.g. Sec.~4.3 of Ref.~\cite{GriffP09}).
On the other side, the metric components
(\ref{e:loc:Bardeen_metric}) are singular at values of $r$ for which
$2 M(r) = r$. This equation admits two solutions: $r=r_\pm$ with $0 < r_- < r_+$.
By introducing coordinates $(\ti, r, \th, \ph)$ of Eddington-Finkelstein type,
one can show that $\w{g}$ is regular at $r=r_\pm$. The hypersurfaces $r=r_\pm$
turn out to be two Killing horizons; the outermost one ($r=r_+$)
is the black hole event horizon, while the innermost one is a Cauchy horizon
in the maximally extended spacetime (see Fig.~1 of Ref.~\cite{Ansol08}).
The Bardeen metric $\w{g}$ is a solution of the Einstein equation
(\ref{e:fra:Einstein_eq}) sourced by a magnetic monopole in some nonlinear
electrodynamics \cite{AyonG00}. By \defin{nonlinear electrodynamics}\index{nonlinear electrodynamics},
it is meant a theory involving an electromagnetic 2-form $\w{F}$ and for which
the Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}$ is
a nonlinear function of the electromagnetic invariant $\mathcal{F} := F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} / 4$,
the standard Maxwell theory corresponding to the linear case: $\mathcal{L} = - \mathcal{F}/\mu_0$.
Specifically, for the Bardeen black hole, the nonlinear electrodynamics is defined by \cite{AyonG00}
\be \label{e:loc:Lagrangian_Bardeen}
    \mathcal{L} = - \frac{3 m}{\mu_0 |\ell|\ell^2} \left(
    \frac{\sqrt{2\ell^2 \mathcal{F}}}{1 + \sqrt{2\ell^2 \mathcal{F}}} \right) ^{5/2}
\ee
and the electromagnetic field is
\be
    \w{F} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \ell \sin\th \, \dd\th \wedge \dd\ph,
\ee
which corresponds to a magnetic monopole $\ell$ located at the center of symmetry
(cf. Remark~\ref{r:sta:magnetic_monopole} on p.~\pageref{r:sta:magnetic_monopole}).

The energy-momentum tensor\footnote{For a Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{F})$,
the energy-momentum tensor is
$T_{\alpha\beta} = - \mathcal{L}'(\mathcal{F}) F_{\mu\alpha} F^\mu_{\ \, \beta}
        + \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{F}) \, g_{\alpha\beta}$,
which generalizes the Maxwellian expression~(\ref{e:fra:T_em}) to nonlinear electrodynamics.}
$\w{T}$ derived from the Lagrangian density (\ref{e:loc:Lagrangian_Bardeen})
fulfills the weak energy condition (\ref{e:def:WEC}), which implies the null energy condition and
thus the null convergence condition.
Moreover, the Bardeen spacetime contains trapped surfaces in the region $r_- < r < r_+$. Yet all inextendible null geodesics are complete. The Bardeen spacetime evades Penrose's singularity theorem
because it does not admit any non-compact Cauchy surface (actually no Cauchy surface at all). More precisely, in the internal region
it admits a \emph{partial} Cauchy surface $\Sigma$ to which the boundary $\mathscr{F}$
of the causal future of a given trapped surface $\Sp$ can be mapped injectively.
However $\Sigma$ is compact,
having the topology of $\SS^3$ (see \cite{Borde97} for details), so that one cannot reach
the contradiction completing the proof of Penrose's theorem.
\end{example}


\subsection{Hawking \& Penrose's singularity theorem}

Among the three hypotheses of Penrose's singularity theorem (Property~\ref{p:loc:Penrose_sing_thm}),
the first one, namely there exists a non-compact Cauchy surface, is an assumption about the \emph{global} structure of spacetime. It cannot be checked by any local physical experiment.
As the Bardeen black hole shows (Example~\ref{x:loc:Bardeen_BH}), one cannot get rid of this hypothesis
without replacing it by other ones.
It turns out that it is possible find more local hypotheses:
a stronger convergence condition and the non-existence of closed timelike curve.
More precisely, we have:

\begin{prop}[Hawking-Penrose theorem\index{Hawking-Penrose theorem}\index{singularity!Hawking-Penrose -- theorem} \textnormal{(1970\index[pers]{Hawking, S.W.}\index[pers]{Penrose, R.} \cite{HawkiP70})}]
\label{p:loc:Hawking_Penrose_thm}
Let $(\M,\w{g})$ be a $n$-dimensional time-orientable spacetime ($n\ge 3$) such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\M$ does not contain any closed timelike curve;
\item the \defin{causal convergence condition}\index{causal!convergence condition}\index{convergence!condition!causal --} holds on $\M$:
\be \label{e:loc:conver_cond}
    \encadre{ \w{R}(\w{v}, \w{v}) \geq 0 \quad \mbox{for any timelike or null vector $\w{v}$} },
\ee
where $\w{R}$ is
$\w{g}$'s Ricci tensor --- for general relativity with a cosmological constant $\Lambda$,
such a condition is
equivalent to the
\defin{strong energy condition}\index{strong!energy condition}\index{energy!condition!strong --}:
\be \label{e:loc:SEC}
  \w{T}(\w{v}, \w{v}) - \frac{1}{n-2}\left(T - \frac{\Lambda}{4\pi} \right) \w{v}\cdot\w{v} \geq 0 \quad \mbox{for any timelike or null vector $\w{v}$} ,
\ee
where $\w{T}$ is the matter energy-momentum tensor and $T := g^{\mu\nu} T_{\mu\nu}$ is its trace;
\item the following \defin{generic condition}\index{generic!condition} holds: every causal geodesic contains at least one point at which
the (nonzero) tangent vectors $\w{v}$ fulfill
\be \label{e:loc:generic_cond}
    v^{[\alpha} R^{\beta]}_{\ \; \mu\nu[\gamma} v_{\delta]} v^\mu v^\nu \neq 0 ,
\ee
where $R^\alpha_{\ \; \beta\gamma\delta}$ is $\w{g}$'s Riemann curvature tensor;
\item $\M$ contains at least one of the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item a trapped surface,
\item a point $p$ such that the expansion of all the future-directed null geodesics,
or of all the past-directed null geodesics, emanating from $p$
becomes negative at some point along each geodesic,
\item a spacelike compact hypersurface without boundary (i.e. an embedded compact manifold of
dimension $n-1$).
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
Then $\M$ contains at least one incomplete inextendible causal geodesic.
\end{prop}
The proof is quite long and we refer to HE \cite{HawkiE73}, p.~267, where
it is given for $n=4$, the generalization to any dimension being
straightforward (see also Sec.~5 of Ref.~\cite{Senov98} and Sec.~5.1.4 of Ref.~\cite{SenovG15}).
Here, we shall limit ourselves to a few comments:
\begin{itemize}
\item The non-existence of closed timelike curves is a much weaker condition
than the existence of a Cauchy surface required in Penrose's theorem
(Property~\ref{p:loc:Penrose_sing_thm}), the latter condition implying the former one.
\item On the other side, the causal convergence condition (\ref{e:loc:conver_cond}) is stronger
than the null convergence condition (\ref{e:neh:null_energy_cond}) involved
in Penrose's theorem, for
it has to hold for timelike vectors, in addition to null ones.
\item For general relativity,
the causal convergence condition (\ref{e:loc:conver_cond}) is equivalent to
the strong energy condition (\ref{e:loc:SEC}) thanks to the
Einstein equation (\ref{e:fra:Einstein_eq_n}).
For a perfect fluid\index{perfect fluid}\index{fluid!perfect --} of proper energy density $\rho$ and pressure $p$,
the energy-momentum is
$\w{T} = (\rho + p) \uu{u}\otimes\uu{u} + p \w{g}$ and the strong energy condition
(\ref{e:loc:SEC}) is equivalent to
\be \label{e:loc:SEC_fluid}
    (n-3) \rho + (n-1) p - \frac{\Lambda}{4\pi} \geq 0 .
\ee
Note that, even for $\Lambda=0$, the strong energy condition does \emph{not} imply the
weak energy condition\index{weak!energy condition}\index{energy!condition!weak --}
introduced in Sec.~\ref{s:def:null_convergence_cond} [Eq.~(\ref{e:def:WEC})],
contrary to what the names may suggest. The only logical connection between
the two conditions is that both imply the null energy condition (\ref{e:neh:null_energy_cond_matter}).
\item For timelike geodesics, the generic condition (\ref{e:loc:generic_cond})
is equivalent to\footnote{To see it, it suffices to contract (\ref{e:loc:generic_cond}) by
$v_\alpha v^\delta$ and use the symmetries of the Riemann tensor (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:curvat}).}
\be \label{e:loc:gen_cond_timelike}
    R^\alpha_{\ \; \mu\nu\beta} v^\mu v^\nu \neq 0 .
\ee
In view of the geodesic deviation equation\index{geodesic!deviation equation}\index{deviation!geodesic --}
(\ref{e:geo:geod_deviation_index}), this implies that the relative acceleration in any timelike
geodesic congruence cannot vanish identically along the geodesics. In physical terms, this means
that tidal forces\index{tidal force} are necessarily felt sometime along the worldline of any inertial observer. Apart from flat (Minkowski) spacetime, this condition is violated only in peculiar cases,
involving a high degree of symmetry, hence the qualifier \emph{generic}. An example is the Einstein static universe\index{Einstein!static universe}\index{static!universe (Einstein)} considered in Sec.~\ref{s:glo:conf_complet_Mink} [Eq.~(\ref{e:glo:tg_Einstein})]:
it can be shown \cite{Senov98} that the curves $(\chi,\th,\ph) = \mathrm{const}$ are timelike geodesics that have $R^\alpha_{\ \; \mu\nu\beta} v^\mu v^\nu  = 0$ all along them.
\item Hypothesis 4 of the Hawking-Penrose theorem is more general than the requirement of
a trapped surface in Penrose's theorem (Property~\ref{p:loc:Penrose_sing_thm}), since the
trapped surface can be replaced by a light cone that reconverges in the future
(case (b)) or a spacelike compact hypersurface (case (c)). The latter possibility arises
in spatially closed cosmological models, such as the de Sitter spacetime\index{de Sitter spacetime}
(cf. Example~\ref{x:glo:dS4} on p.~\pageref{x:glo:dS4}), which admits spacelike hypersurfaces of $\SS^3$ topology. This does not occur in Minkowski spacetime: embedded hypersurfaces with $\SS^3$ topology
are of course possible (the unit sphere of $\R^4$ !), but they cannot be everywhere spacelike.
\item The Hawking-Penrose theorem does not specify whether the incomplete geodesic is timelike or
null and whether it is future-incomplete or past-incomplete; it is therefore less precise
than Penrose's singularity theorem, which tells that the incomplete geodesic is null and future-incomplete.
It can be argued however that in the case (4a) (trapped surface), the geodesic is
future-incomplete (cf.  Ref.~\cite{Senov98}, p.~792).
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
Hypothesis (4c) (existence of a spacelike compact hypersurface) is
that stated in the original article by Hawking \& Penrose \cite{HawkiP70}.
It can be generalized to the existence of an achronal\index{achronal} compact set without
edge (cf. Theorem~2 on p.~266 of HE \cite{HawkiE73} and Theorem~5.6 of Ref.~\cite{Senov98}).
\end{remark}

\begin{example}[strong energy condition]
Let us check that the strong energy condition (\ref{e:loc:SEC}) holds for the classical
spacetimes involved in Examples~\ref{x:loc:Penrose_thm_Schwarz} (Schwarzschild),
\ref{x:loc:Penrose_thm_OS} (Oppenheimer-Snyder) and \ref{x:loc:Penrose_thm_Vaidya} (Vaidya).
For the Schwarzschild black hole, this is trivial since $\w{T} = 0$ and $\Lambda=0$.
For the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse, still $\Lambda=0$ and we note that the matter is a
perfect fluid with $\rho \geq 0$ and $p=0$,
so that the fluid strong energy condition~(\ref{e:loc:SEC_fluid}) is fulfilled.
For the Vaidya collapse, the energy-momentum tensor $\w{T}$ is given by Eq.~(\ref{e:vai:ener_mom_tensor}),
which yields $\w{T}(\w{v},\w{v}) = M'(v) (\w{k}\cdot\w{v})^2 / (4\pi r^2)$ and $T = 0$. Given that
$M'(v) \geq 0$ and $\Lambda=0$, it is clear that (\ref{e:loc:SEC}) is satisfied.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Bardeen regular black hole as a counter-example]
We have seen in Example~\ref{x:loc:Bardeen_BH} that the Bardeen
black hole, which has no singularity and is geodesically complete, evades
Penrose's theorem \ref{p:loc:Penrose_sing_thm} because it has no Cauchy surface. It must evade the
Hawking-Penrose theorem~\ref{p:loc:Hawking_Penrose_thm} as well.
Hypothesis~1 of
that theorem
is fulfilled: the Bardeen spacetime does not contain any closed timelike curve.
Hypotheses~3 and 4a are fulfilled as well. The only reason for which the Hawking-Penrose theorem
does not apply is actually hypothesis~2: the strong energy condition is violated
by the nonlinear-electrodynamics energy-momentum tensor sourcing the Bardeen solution
(albeit the weak energy condition is not).
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
The scope of the Hawking-Penrose theorem goes beyond gravitational collapse and
black hole physics. It encompasses cosmology and can be used to predict the Big-Bang singularity,
via the hypothesis (4b) with the point $p$ being our current position in the Universe and
considering the past-directed null goedesics (our past light-cone) (see Sec.~10.1 of HE~\cite{HawkiE73}
for details).
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
Both Penrose and Hawking-Penrose theorems have been generalized to $n$-dimensional spacetimes containing a ``trapped'' submanifold
of any codimension (the codimension is $2$ in Penrose's theorem~\ref{p:loc:Penrose_sing_thm}
and $2$, $n$ and $1$ for respectively cases (4a), (4b) and (4c) of Hawking-Penrose theorem \ref{p:loc:Hawking_Penrose_thm}) by Gregory Galloway\index[pers]{Galloway, G.J.} and
José Senovilla\index[pers]{Senovilla, J.M.M.} in 2010 \cite{GalloS10}.
In this work,
the concept of trapped surface\index{trapped!surface}, a priori defined for
codimension 2 only (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:loc:trapped_surf}), is generalized to any codimension
by demanding that the mean curvature vector of the submanifold is everywhere future-directed timelike; moreover, the null and causal convergence conditions
are generalized to inequalities involving the Riemann tensor.
\end{remark}

\begin{hist}
The singularity theorem established by Roger Penrose\index[pers]{Penrose, R.}
in 1965 \cite{Penro65} (Property~\ref{p:loc:Penrose_sing_thm})
was a major breakthrough in general relativity and mathematical physics.
It introduced a brand new concept, that of trapped surfaces\index{trapped!surface}, which revealed to
be extremely fruitful in relativistic gravity. It also brought in the characterization of
spacetime singularities\index{singularity!spacetime --}\index{spacetime!singularity} by geodesic incompleteness. This novel view point on
singularities was subsequently advocated by Robert Geroch\index[pers]{Geroch, R.}
in 1968 \cite{Geroc68} and Stephen Hawking\index[pers]{Hawking, S.W.} and George Ellis\index[pers]{Ellis, G.F.R.} in their 1973 textbook~\cite{HawkiE73}; it is nowadays the standard one. From an astrophysical perspective, Penrose's theorem showed that
once a gravitational collapse has reached a certain stage, characterized by the appearance
of trapped surfaces, then the formation of a singularity is inevitable, whatever the
geometry of the collapse and the stiffness of the matter's equation of state may be (provided
the very mild null energy condition is obeyed). Previously, it could have been
argued that the central singularity obtained in exact solutions, like that
of the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse (Chap.~\ref{s:lem}), is an artifact of spherical
symmetry or the assumption of zero pressure, so that e.g. rotation or high pressures could
prevent the singularity from appearing. For this achievement, Roger Penrose was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2020.
More details about the history of Penrose's theorem and its impact can be found
in the review articles \cite{Senov22a,Senov22b,SenovG15,Lands22}.
As for the theorem
proven in 1970 by Stephen Hawking \index[pers]{Hawking, S.W.} and
Roger Penrose \cite{HawkiP70} (Property~\ref{p:loc:Hawking_Penrose_thm}),
it is still considered today as the best singularity theorem.
