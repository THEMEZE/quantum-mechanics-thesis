	abstract = {It was recently predicted [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 81 938 (1998)] that atom-atom scattering under transverse harmonic confinement is subject to a “confinement-induced resonance” where the effective one-dimensional coupling strength diverges at a particular ratio of the confinement and scattering lengths. As the initial prediction made use of the zero-range pseudopotential approximation, we now report numerical results for finite-range interaction potentials that corroborate this resonance. In addition, we now present a physical interpretation of this effect as a novel type of Feshbach resonance in which the transverse modes of the confining potential assume the roles of “open” and “closed” scattering channels.},

For expansion from a harmonic trap, and in the limits of very weak and very strong interactions, we recover the self-similar scaling solutions known from the hydrodynamic approach. For all other power-law traps and arbitrary interaction strengths, the expansion is not self-similar and shows strong dependence of the density profile evolution on the trap anharmonicity. We also characterize dynamical fermionization of the expanding cloud in terms of correlation functions describing phase and density fluctuations.},

We argue that the integrability of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation is linked to the existence of such long-lived nonthermal states and illustrate this by showing that such states are not supported within a nonintegrable model of two coupled 1D gases of different masses. We go beyond a classical-field analysis, taking into account the quantum noise introduced by the discreteness of losses, and show that the nonthermal state is still produced and its nonthermal character is even enhanced.

Quantum statistics dictates the behavior of identical particles in the quantum world: Bosons like to congregate, whereas fermions avoid one another. However, strong interactions can cause a string of bosons to behave like fermions. This so-called fermionization phenomenon has been studied in equilibrium. Wilson et al. instead focused on dynamical fermionization in a nonequilibrium system consisting of tubes of strongly interacting bosonic rubidium atoms. After letting the tubes expand in the axial direction, the researchers monitored the momentum distribution of the atoms and found that it evolved from bosonic-like to fermionic-like.
Science, this issue p. 1461
The wave function of a Tonks-Girardeau (T-G) gas of strongly interacting bosons in one dimension maps onto the absolute value of the wave function of a noninteracting Fermi gas. Although this fermionization makes many aspects of the two gases identical, their equilibrium momentum distributions are quite different. We observed dynamical fermionization, where the momentum distribution of a T-G gas evolves from bosonic to fermionic after its axial confinement is removed. The asymptotic momentum distribution after expansion in one dimension is the distribution of rapidities, which are the conserved quantities associated with many-body integrable systems. Our measurements agree well with T-G gas theory. We also studied momentum evolution after the trap depth is suddenly changed to a new nonzero value, and we observed the theoretically predicted bosonic-fermionic oscillations.
The momentum distribution of an expanding one-dimensional Bose gas evolves from bosonic to fermionic.

The relevant integrals expressing the one-body density matrix are evaluated for small numbers of particles in a simple Monte Carlo approach to test the extent of the asymptotic law and to illustrate the slow decay of correlations between the matter–wave field at different points.},

	abstract = {We study the integrable model of one-dimensional bosons with contact repulsion. In the limit of weak interaction, we use the microscopic hydrodynamic theory to obtain the excitation spectrum. The statistics of quasiparticles changes with the increase of momentum. At lowest momenta good quasiparticles are fermions, while at higher momenta they are Bogoliubov bosons, in accordance with recent studies. In the limit of strong interaction, we analyze the exact solution and find exact results for the spectrum in terms of the asymptotic series. Those results undoubtedly suggest that fermionic quasiparticle excitations actually exist at all momenta for moderate and strong interaction and also at lowest momenta for arbitrary interaction. Moreover, at strong interaction we find highly accurate analytical results for several relevant quantities of the Lieb-Liniger model.},

	abstract = {Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of an ideal gas is investigated for a finite number of particles. In three dimensions, we find a transition temperature which is lower than in the thermodynamic limit. Lowering the dimension increases the transition temperature and is therefore favorable for BEC. This is in contrast to the standard result obtained in the thermodynamic limit which states that BEC is not possible in, e.g., a one-dimensional (1D) harmonic potential. As a result, 1D atom traps, such as radially tightly confining magnetic traps or optical dipole traps, are promising for studying BEC. © 1996 The American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {For a decade the fate of a one-dimensional gas of interacting bosons in an external trapping potential remained mysterious. We here show that whenever the underlying integrability of the gas is broken by the presence of the external potential, the inevitable diffusive rearrangements between the quasiparticles, quantified by the diffusion constants of the gas, eventually lead the system to thermalize at late times. We show that the full thermalizing dynamics can be described by the generalized hydrodynamics with diffusion and force terms, and we compare these predictions to numerical simulations. Finally, we provide an explanation for the slow thermalization rates observed in numerical and experimental settings: the hydrodynamics of integrable models is characterized by a continuity of modes, which can have arbitrarily small diffusion coefficients. As a consequence, the approach to thermalization can display prethermal plateau and relaxation dynamics with long polynomial finite-time corrections.},
