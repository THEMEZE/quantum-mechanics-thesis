	abstract = {We develop a finite-temperature hydrodynamic approach for a harmonically trapped one-dimensional quasicondensate and apply it to describe the phenomenon of frequency doubling in the breathing-mode oscillations of the quasicondensate momentum distribution. The doubling here refers to the oscillation frequency relative to the oscillations of the real-space density distribution, invoked by a sudden confinement quench. By constructing a nonequilibrium phase diagram that characterizes the regime of frequency doubling and its gradual disappearance, we find that this crossover is governed by the quench strength and the initial temperature rather than by the equilibrium-state crossover from the quasicondensate to the ideal Bose gas regime. The hydrodynamic predictions are supported by the results of numerical simulations based on a finite-temperature c-field approach and extend the utility of the hydrodynamic theory for low-dimensional quantum gases to the description of finite-temperature systems and their dynamics in momentum space.},

Using the Luttinger liquid approach, we derive an analytic expression for the momentum correlation function in the quasicondensate regime, showing (i) the reduction and broadening of the opposite-momentum correlations (compared to the singular behavior in a true condensate) and (ii) an emergence of anticorrelations at small momenta.

These equations, referred to as the Tan relations, relate a microscopic quantity, namely, the amplitude of the high-momentum tail of the fermion momentum distribution, to the thermodynamics of the many-body system. In this work, we provide experimental verification of the Tan relations in a strongly interacting gas of fermionic atoms by measuring both the microscopic and macroscopic quantities in the same system.},

	abstract = {We analyze free expansion of a trapped one-dimensional Bose gas after a sudden release from the confining trap potential. By using the stationary phase and local density approximations, we show that the long-time asymptotic density profile and the momentum distribution of the gas are determined by the initial distribution of Bethe rapidities (quasimomenta) and hence can be obtained from the solutions to the Lieb-Liniger equations in the thermodynamic limit. For expansion from a harmonic trap, and in the limits of very weak and very strong interactions, we recover the self-similar scaling solutions known from the hydrodynamic approach. For all other power-law traps and arbitrary interaction strengths, the expansion is not self-similar and shows strong dependence of the density profile evolution on the trap anharmonicity. We also characterize dynamical fermionization of the expanding cloud in terms of correlation functions describing phase and density fluctuations.},

After losses have been turned off, this state is robust with respect to the nonlinear dynamics, described by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We argue that the integrability of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation is linked to the existence of such long-lived nonthermal states and illustrate this by showing that such states are not supported within a nonintegrable model of two coupled 1D gases of different masses. We go beyond a classical-field analysis, taking into account the quantum noise introduced by the discreteness of losses, and show that the nonthermal state is still produced and its nonthermal character is even enhanced. Finally, we extend the discussion to gases trapped in a harmonic potential and present experimental observations of a long-lived nonthermal state within a trapped 1D quasicondensate following an atom-loss process.},

	abstract = {We analyze the equilibrium properties of a weakly interacting, trapped quasi-one-dimensional Bose gas at finite temperatures and compare different theoretical approaches. We focus in particular on two stochastic theories: a number-conserving Bogoliubov (ncB) approach and a stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation (sGPe) that have been extensively used in numerical simulations. Equilibrium properties like density profiles, correlation functions, and the condensate statistics are compared to predictions based upon a number of alternative theories. We find that due to thermal phase fluctuations, and the corresponding condensate depletion, the ncB approach loses its validity at relatively low temperatures. This can be attributed to the change in the Bogoliubov spectrum, as the condensate gets thermally depleted, and to large fluctuations beyond perturbation theory. Although the two stochastic theories are built on different thermodynamic ensembles (ncB: canonical, sGPe: grand-canonical), they yield the correct condensate statistics in a large BEC (strong enough particle interactions). For smaller systems, the sGPe results are prone to anomalously large number fluctuations, well-known for the grand-canonical, ideal Bose gas. Based on the comparison of the above theories to the modified Popov approach, we propose a simple procedure for approximately extracting the Penrose-Onsager condensate from first- and second-order correlation functions that is computationally convenient. This also clarifies the link between condensate and quasi-condensate in the Popov theory of low-dimensional systems.},

First order and second order correlation functions of the atomic field are used to characterize the coherence properties of the gas along the axis of the guide. The coherence length of the gas is found to be much larger than the thermal de Broglie wavelength in the strongly quantum degenerate regime. Large intensity fluctuations present in the ideal Bose gas model are found to be strongly reduced by repulsive atomic interactions; this conclusion is obtained with a one-dimensional classical field approximation valid when the temperature of the gas is much higher than its chemical potential, k B T » {\textbar}μ{\textbar}.},

	abstract = {Isolated quantum many-body systems with integrable dynamics generically do not thermalize when taken far from equilibrium. As one perturbs such systems away from the integrable point, thermalization sets in, but the nature of the crossover from integrable to thermalizing behavior is an unresolved and actively discussed question. We explore this question by studying the dynamics of the momentum distribution function in a dipolar quantum Newton’s cradle consisting of highly magnetic dysprosium atoms. This is accomplished by creating the first one-dimensional Bose gas with strong magnetic dipole-dipole interactions. These interactions provide tunability of both the strength of the integrability-breaking perturbation and the nature of the near-integrable dynamics. We provide the first experimental evidence that thermalization close to a strongly interacting integrable point occurs in two steps: prethermalization followed by near-exponential thermalization. Exact numerical calculations on a two-rung lattice model yield a similar two-timescale process, suggesting that this is generic in strongly interacting near-integrable models. Moreover, the measured thermalization rate is consistent with a parameter-free theoretical estimate, based on identifying the types of collisions that dominate thermalization. By providing tunability between regimes of integrable and nonintegrable dynamics, our work sheds light on the mechanisms by which isolated quantum many-body systems thermalize and on the temporal structure of the onset of thermalization.},

The quasicondensation crossover is investigated via two different experimental parameter sets, corresponding to the two different sides of the crossover. Classical field theory is expected to correctly describe the quasicondensation crossover of weakly interacting gases.

	abstract = {Interactions are known to have dramatic effects on bosonic gases in one dimension (1D). Not only does the ground state transform from a condensate like state to an effective Fermi sea, but new fundamental excitations, which do not have any higher-dimensional equivalents, are predicted to appear. In this work, we trace these elusive excitations via their effects on the dynamical structure factor of 1D strongly interacting Bose gases at low temperature. An array of 1D Bose gases is obtained by loading a 87Rb condensate in a two-dimensional lattice potential. The dynamical structure factor of the system is probed by energy deposition through low-momentum Bragg excitations. The experimental signals are compared to recent theoretical predictions for the dynamical structure factor of the Lieb-Liniger model at T{\textgreater}0. Our results demonstrate that the main contribution to the spectral widths stems from the dynamics of the interaction-induced excitations in the gas, which cannot be described by the Luttinger liquid theory.},

Quantum statistics dictates the behavior of identical particles in the quantum world: Bosons like to congregate, whereas fermions avoid one another. However, strong interactions can cause a string of bosons to behave like fermions. This so-called fermionization phenomenon has been studied in equilibrium. Wilson et al. instead focused on dynamical fermionization in a nonequilibrium system consisting of tubes of strongly interacting bosonic rubidium atoms. After letting the tubes expand in the axial direction, the researchers monitored the momentum distribution of the atoms and found that it evolved from bosonic-like to fermionic-like.
Science, this issue p. 1461
The wave function of a Tonks-Girardeau (T-G) gas of strongly interacting bosons in one dimension maps onto the absolute value of the wave function of a noninteracting Fermi gas. Although this fermionization makes many aspects of the two gases identical, their equilibrium momentum distributions are quite different. We observed dynamical fermionization, where the momentum distribution of a T-G gas evolves from bosonic to fermionic after its axial confinement is removed. The asymptotic momentum distribution after expansion in one dimension is the distribution of rapidities, which are the conserved quantities associated with many-body integrable systems. Our measurements agree well with T-G gas theory. We also studied momentum evolution after the trap depth is suddenly changed to a new nonzero value, and we observed the theoretically predicted bosonic-fermionic oscillations.
The momentum distribution of an expanding one-dimensional Bose gas evolves from bosonic to fermionic.

In the limit of strong interaction, we analyze the exact solution and find exact results for the spectrum in terms of the asymptotic series. Those results undoubtedly suggest that fermionic quasiparticle excitations actually exist at all momenta for moderate and strong interaction and also at lowest momenta for arbitrary interaction. Moreover, at strong interaction we find highly accurate analytical results for several relevant quantities of the Lieb-Liniger model.},

We show that the full thermalizing dynamics can be described by the generalized hydrodynamics with diffusion and force terms, and we compare these predictions to numerical simulations. Finally, we provide an explanation for the slow thermalization rates observed in numerical and experimental settings: the hydrodynamics of integrable models is characterized by a continuity of modes, which can have arbitrarily small diffusion coefficients. As a consequence, the approach to thermalization can display prethermal plateau and relaxation dynamics with long polynomial finite-time corrections.},

	abstract = {In quantum gases with contact repulsion, the distribution of momenta of the atoms typically decays as \${\textbackslash}sim 1/{\textbar}p{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}4\$ at large momentum \$p\$. At thermal equilibrium, Tan's relation connects the amplitude of that \$1/{\textbar}p{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}4\$ tail to the adiabatic derivative of the energy with respect to the gas' coupling constant or scattering length. Here it is shown that the relation breaks down in the one-dimensional Bose gas with contact repulsion subject to atom losses. Immediately after a loss event, the wavefunction has a ghost singularity whose effect on the momentum distribution is unaccounted for by the usual term in Tan's relation. Because of the existence of infinitely many conserved quantities, even after relaxation, this effect remains. It is reflected in the rapidity distribution, which itself acquires a \$1/{\textbar}p{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}4\$ tail. In the momentum distribution, that tail adds to the usual term. This phenomenon is discussed for arbitrary interaction strengths, and it is supported by exact calculations in the two asymptotic regimes of infinite and weak repulsion.},

Combining thermal Bethe ansatz, local-density approximation, and exact quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we show that the contact is a universal function of only two scaling parameters, and determine the scaling function.

Most people have an intuitive understanding of temperature. In the context of statistical mechanics, the higher the temperature, the more a system is removed from its lowest energy state. Things become more complicated in a nonequilibrium system governed by quantum mechanics and constrained by several conserved quantities. Langen et al. showed that as many as 10 temperature-like parameters are necessary to describe the steady state of a one-dimensional gas of Rb atoms that was split into two in a particular way (see the Perspective by Spielman).
Science, this issue p. 207; see also p. 185
The description of the non-equilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum many-body systems within the framework of statistical mechanics is a fundamental open question. Conventional thermodynamical ensembles fail to describe the large class of systems that exhibit nontrivial conserved quantities, and generalized ensembles have been predicted to maximize entropy in these systems. We show experimentally that a degenerate one-dimensional Bose gas relaxes to a state that can be described by such a generalized ensemble. This is verified through a detailed study of correlation functions up to 10th order. The applicability of the generalized ensemble description for isolated quantum many-body systems points to a natural emergence of classical statistical properties from the microscopic unitary quantum evolution.
Interferometry suggests that as many as 10 parameters are needed to describe the steady state of an integrable system. [Also see Perspective by Spielman]

Finite delay time associated with penetration of quantum particles through each other in the course of a pairwise one-dimensional collision in the presence of the longitudinal potential makes the system non-integrable and, hence, provides a mechanism for relaxation to thermal equilibrium. To analyse this effect quantitatively in the limit of a non-degenerate gas, we develop a system of kinetic equations and solve it for small-amplitude monopole oscillations of the gas. The obtained damping rate is long enough to be neglected in a realistic cold-atom experiment, and therefore longitudinal trapping does not hinder integrable dynamics of atomic gases in the 1D regime.},

Using finite temperature c-field methods, we calculate the characteristic relaxation rates to the final equilibrium state. Hence, we identify the different dynamical regimes of the system in the parameter space that characterizes the strength of interatomic interactions, the initial temperature, and the magnitude of the Bragg momentum used to initiate the collisional oscillations of the cradle. In all parameter regimes, we find that the system relaxes to a final equilibrium state for which the momentum distribution is consistent with a thermal distribution. For sufficiently large initial Bragg momentum, the system can undergo hundreds of repeated collisional oscillations before reaching the final thermal equilibrium. The corresponding thermalization timescales can reach tens of seconds, which is an order of magnitude smaller than in the strongly interacting regime.},

We observe the statistical nature of the appearance of phase fluctuations and characterize the dependence of their average value on temperature, number of particles, and the trapping potential. We find pronounced phase fluctuations for condensates in very elongated traps in a broad temperature range. The results are of great importance for the realization of BEC in quasi-1D geometries, for matter wave interferometry with BECs, as well as for coherence properties of guided atom laser beams.},

While initially suppressed in the trap, density fluctuations emerge gradually during expansion as a result of initial phase fluctuations present in the trapped quasicondensate. Asymptotically, they are governed by the thermal coherence length of the system. Our measurements take place in an intermediate regime where density correlations are related to near-field diffraction effects and anomalous correlations play an important role. Comparison with a recent theoretical approach described by Imambekov et al. yields good agreement with our experimental results and shows that density correlations can be used for thermometry of quasicondensates.},

The effect, although being invisible in the evolution of the in situ density profile of the gas, can be revealed through a nontrivial periodic narrowing of its momentum distribution, taking place at twice the rate of the fundamental breathing-mode frequency. We identify physical regimes for observing the many-body bounce and construct the respective nonequilibrium phase diagram as a function of the quench strength and the initial temperature of the gas. We also develop a finite-temperature hydrodynamic theory of the TG gas wherein the many-body bounce is explained by an increased thermodynamic pressure during the isentropic compression cycle, which acts as a potential barrier for the particles to bounce off.},

A key challenge is the scarcity of experimental tools for the characterization of complex transient states. We used measurements of full quantum mechanical probability distributions of matter-wave interference to study the relaxation dynamics of a coherently split one-dimensional Bose gas and obtained comprehensive information about the dynamical states of the system. After an initial rapid evolution, the full distributions reveal the approach toward a thermal-like steady state characterized by an effective temperature that is independent from the initial equilibrium temperature of the system before the splitting process. We conjecture that this state can be described through a generalized Gibbs ensemble and associate it with prethermalization.

Collisions between different components are accounted for through the inclusion of a Boltzmann-type collision integral in the hydrodynamic equation. Contrary to standard generalized hydrodynamics, our extended model captures thermalization of the condensate at a rate consistent with experimental observations from a quantum Newton’s cradle setup.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06651},
	abstract = {The dynamics of strongly interacting many-body quantum systems are notoriously complex and difficult to simulate. A new theory, generalized hydrodynamics (GHD), promises to efficiently accomplish such simulations for nearly-integrable systems. It predicts the evolution of the distribution of rapidities, which are the momenta of the quasiparticles in integrable systems. GHD was recently tested experimentally for weakly interacting atoms, but its applicability to strongly interacting systems has not been experimentally established. Here we test GHD with bundles of one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases by performing large trap quenches in both the strong and intermediate coupling regimes. We measure the evolving distribution of rapidities, and find that theory and experiment agree well over dozens of trap oscillations, for average dimensionless coupling strengths that range from 0.3 to 9.3. By also measuring momentum distributions, we gain experimental access to the interaction energy and thus to how the quasiparticles themselves evolve. The accuracy of GHD demonstrated here confirms its wide applicability to the simulation of nearly-integrable quantum dynamical systems. Future experimental studies are needed to explore GHD in spin chains, as well as the crossover between GHD and regular hydrodynamics in the presence of stronger integrability breaking perturbations.},

It is shown how this method can be used to achieve adiabatic magnetic transport from one reservoir to another. In the first experimental realization of a microfabricated magnetic neutral-atom trap, efficient loading is achieved with a novel mirror-magneto-optic trap. A cloud of rubidium atoms is stored and compressed using the magnetic field of a “U”-shaped wire carrying a current of 2 A. An evaporation mechanism is demonstrated which removes hot atoms from the trap by collisions with the substrate surface.},
